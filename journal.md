# August 31st

To start my PCB project, I followed [Maggi's Hackclub Jam tutorial](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card)
I followed the appoximately 30 minute tutorial (however all the trial and erroring, learning how to make a PCB for the first time, and solving issues took me 1.5 hours) 
To start, I first made my schematic using similar materials as the tutorial, but I added a green LED instead of a yellow one.

I used an NFC antenna, an NFC chip, a capacitor, a 47 ohms resistor, and a 2V LED

After that was done, I started to organize my PCB, but a problem I was having was a small connection not connecting. (gray)

However, I soon figured out that you can simply make your wires ignore the "illegal" connection by changing a setting. 

Next, I ensured no connections were intercepting (so my PCB doesnt short circut!) and routed all my other components together

After that I added my name, a QR code to my portfolio website, alongside my GitHub and the link to my site.
I used the trick from the tutorial to make my icons shiny with the solder mask. 
This is what the 3D view looked like:

Later, I plan to add some designs and make it look more visually appealing
**Total time spent: 1.5 hrs**
