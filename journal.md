# August 31st (2PM-3:30PM)

To start my PCB project, I followed [Maggi's Hackclub Jam tutorial](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card)
I followed the appoximately 30 minute tutorial (however all the trial and erroring, learning how to make a PCB for the first time, and solving issues took me 1.5 hours) 
To start, I first made my schematic using similar materials as the tutorial, but I added a green LED instead of a yellow one. 
<br></br>

I used an NFC antenna, an NFC chip, a capacitor, a 47 ohms resistor, and a 2V LED

After that was done, I started to organize my PCB, but a problem I was having was a small connection not connecting. (gray)

<br></br>
However, I soon figured out that you can simply make your wires ignore the "illegal" connection by changing a setting. 

Next, I ensured no connections were intercepting (so my PCB doesnt short circut!) and routed all my other components together

After that I added my name, a QR code to my portfolio website, alongside my GitHub and the link to my site.
I used the trick from the tutorial to make my icons shiny with the solder mask. 
This is what the 3D view looked like:

<br></br>
Later, I plan to add some designs and make it look more visually appealing

# August 31st (8PM - 9PM)

Now to customize my PCB, I decided to go with a topographic design using contour lines, I used a Canva element, and I imported it into EasyEDA.
First, I stretched it out on the back side of the PCB, and used silk screen as my texture. I then added my name and my website on the back as well.
I also created a solid layer on the back so that the led on the front can sort of shine through the PCB, and create a cool effect.

Later on, I decided to switch my LED colour to yellow because I was going to make my PCB black, so yellow would look nicer. 
I updated my schematic like so:

After that, I added the topographic look to the front of the PCB as well since the front was looking a bit empty. I wanted to keep it subtle so I added it in the top layer instead of the bottom. 
Here is what it looks like:
<br></br>
<img width="846" height="508" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/840c5d54-4ef7-4ed7-8706-b810ac439cb6" />
<br></br>
After that, just as I was about to export everything, I realized my image conflicted with the copper being sent towards the resistor, so I has to adjust my design like so:

<br></br>
**Total time spent: 1 hr**
Overall that was how I designed my PCB
